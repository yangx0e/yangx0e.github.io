I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the California Institute of Technology, sponsored by Professors [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm) and [Andrew M. Stuart](http://stuart.caltech.edu/).

Before joining Caltech, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University, and at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications, hosted by Professors [Shiu-Yuen Cheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiu-Yuen_Cheng) and [Lingyun Qiu](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1032/3189.htm).  

I obtained my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in applied mathematics from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Professor [Diogo Gomes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/diogo-gomes).

## Research overview

My research spans scientific computing and machine learning, with a broad interest in numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), mean field games, inverse problems, operator learning, and data-driven scientific discovery.
