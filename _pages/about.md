I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at California Institute of Technology sponsored by Professors [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm) and [Andrew M. Stuart](http://stuart.caltech.edu/). I previously held a postdoctoral position at Tsinghua University and Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications hosted by Professors [Shiu-Yuen Cheng](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1031/2292.htm) and [Lingyun Qiu](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1033/2378.htm). I earned Ph.D. and master degrees in applied mathematics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Professor [Diogo Gomes](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/diogo-gomes).

My research interests include mean field games, partial differential equations, numerical analysis, optimization, and Gaussian processes.
